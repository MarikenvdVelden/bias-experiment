# 'Ideological Biases of the Crowd'? 
Online research compendium of the paper entitled _'Ideological Biases of the Crowd'?_ . This repository combines the [pre-registration plan](docs/pap.pdf) with a data &amp; analysis compendium.

## Draft
View the draft paper [here](report/draft.pdf). This Compendium functions as an online appendix, but [here](X) is also a downloadable version.

## Pre-Registration Plan
* [Experiment](docs/pap.pdf) The expectations and research design to test the implications of ideological biases for crowd coding, which are approved by the VU's ethical committee (see [here](docs/2022-3-30-59.pdf)).

## Data
The following data files might be of interest:

* [Experiment NL](data/intermediate/cleaned_data_nl.RData) Cleaned data with constructed scales for analysis of the experiment in the Dutch case.
* [Experiment US](data/intermediate/cleaned_data_us.RData) Cleaned data with constructed scales for analysis of the experiment in the American case.

See the scripts in [src/data-processing](src/data-processing/prep_data.md) for details on how these files were constructed.

## Results
* [Experiment](src/analysis/analyses.md) Demonstrates the analyses to test and visualise potential annotator bias based on political ideology and political knowledge as pre-registered as well as include exploratory results.
